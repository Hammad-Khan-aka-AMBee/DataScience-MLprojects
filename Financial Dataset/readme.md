LEARNING FINANCIAL DATASET

Using DataScience and Machine Learning, we will create a portfolio of stocks, that will gain reputation in the following years based on capital, inflation rate and market value. For this project I had to go through lengths to learn about Financial Jargon, Short courses on  Banking and Finance, Money Markets and Economics. This has proved to be a wonderful project in Datascience, Developer and Financial skills to sort portfolios regarding our requirements.
