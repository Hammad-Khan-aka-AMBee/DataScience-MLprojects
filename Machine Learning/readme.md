# Machine Learning and Data Science
Using Different Machine Learning Techniques and Neural Netwrok Configurations, we have derived many projects based on real world datasets. The Techniques we have used in these projects are Linear Regressions, Bayes Theorem, Markov Chains, MultiPoint Regressions. 2 Neural Network Configurations we have used, Convolutional and Sequentional. Some of the projects I couldn't complete due to the lack of resources and datasets. My new approach is to combine this real world dataset to my hardware bot and use this Machine Learning approach into my Projects.
